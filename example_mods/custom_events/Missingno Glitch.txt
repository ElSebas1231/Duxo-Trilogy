Value 1: Glitch amount | glitching | chromatic
Value 2: on | chromatic amount                                          (Value 2 is only for glitching or chromatic)
Recommended to use numbers between o to 1.

You can only choose "on" with glitching on Value 1.
With "chromatic" the same, with "amount" is only
a number. If you did not understand the above then:
Glitching screen: v1 = glitching, v2 = on
Chromatic: v1 = chromatic, v2 = your amount
