# How to Compile
First of all you need some specific versions of the libraries that you need to compile a vanilla Psych Engine.
You will need these versions to compile:

- lime 8.0.1
- openfl 9.2.1
- flixel 3.0.2
- flixel-addons 3.0.2
- flixel-tools 1.5.1
- flixel-ui 2.5.0
- hxcpp 4.2.1
- hxCodec 2.6.0
- [nebulazorua's LuaJIT fork](https://github.com/nebulazorua/linc_luajit). You can install it running: `haxelib git linc_luajit https://github.com/nebulazorua/linc_luajit`

With the discord library is the same, don't worry about that.

Note: you will need to have [haxe 4.2.5](https://haxe.org/download/version/4.2.5/) to avoid some problems with newer versions of haxe, with all of this installed, you can compile the game.

If you wanna know why then let me tell you why:
- First. If you have other versions, might broke somethings and maybe you won't be able to compile
- Second. These are the versions I use to compile the game.

And that's all. If you have any issues you can let me know :smiley:
